description: Create a note for the AI table
---

Reuired tag: ai

So we are creating a new node and the only requirement is that it has the AI tag. That's it. You should probably add more tag but this tag is important because this will make sure that it will appear in the AI table. So you don't have to worry about the AI table it's already created. So that's it. So this node specifically, I mean it could be related to other table but I mean the tagging itself and you don't need to create a new view or all that kind of thing. You just create the node, add this tag and add as many other tag as you want. So here's the message.
